###Hi everyone! Welcome to my repository!

##How I am feeling today

I was *so excited* to see that I just got a **94%** on my econ midterm. But a second later...
My friend got **100%??????**

Then I gave up on life and went back to doing chain rule with functions of several variables.

##The definition of a subspace

#####The set of vectors H is a subspace of a vector space V if:
1. The **0** vector of *V* is in *H*
2. All vectors in *H* are closed under addition
3. All vectors in *H* are closed under scalar multiplication
  * _Note: this also proves 1._



##Why do we exist?

* Evolution
* Creation
* Both?
* Neither??
